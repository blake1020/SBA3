            <P>
            <h3>Goal:</h3>
            Get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.
            <h3>Cards:</h3>Cards
            Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, while Jacks, Queens, Kings, and 10s are worth 10. Aces can be played
            as 1 or 11, whichever is best for your hand.
            <h3>Dealing:</h3>
            Players are dealt two cards face up, while the dealer receives two cards, one face up and one face down.
            <h3>Play:</h3>Play
            After receiving your first two cards, you can either "hit" (ask for more cards) or "stand" (keep your
            current hand). The dealer must stand if their total is 17 or more, and take a card if it's 16 or less, until
            they reach 17 or more.
            <h2>Winning:</h2>
            If your total is higher than the dealer's without busting, you win and are paid even money. If you hit
            exactly 21, you can win even more. If you and the dealer both get a natural blackjack (two cards totaling
            21), it's a push, meaning you neither win nor lose.
            <h2>Losing</h2> Losing
            You lose your wager if you bust (go over 21) or if the dealer has a higher total than you.
            Other options
            If you don't like your first two cards, you can surrender, which means the dealer takes half of your bet and
            you discard your hand. You can't surrender if the dealer has blackjack. If the dealer's first card is an
            Ace, you can also buy insurance</P>
